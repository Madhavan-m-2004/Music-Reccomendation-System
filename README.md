# Music Recommendation System ðŸŽµ

This is a simple Music Recommendation System built using Python. It combines both **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** techniques, and includes a GUI built with **Tkinter**.

## Features
- Recommend songs based on user listening history (collaborative filtering).
- Recommend similar songs based on genre/artist metadata (content-based filtering).
- User-friendly GUI for interactive recommendations.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install pandas scikit-learn`
2. Run the GUI: `python gui.py`
3. Enter a user ID and a known song name to see recommendations.
